# Tasker

**Pitch**

Many people(including us) have creative pursuits; projects we want allocate time for; goals to accomplish. In our team, I write; Gem(a contributor to the project) plays music. It’s always been hard for us, and we suspect for many other people, to stay on task. More specifically, it’s even harder to keep track of one’s progress. The timers of our world—smartphones, desktops, etc—aren’t designed to accurately time the tasks we do.

One of the reasons for this is that human error is inevitable. A writer like myself may set the timer to 30 minutes, but halfway through the writing session, I might go make tea. If one is doing it right, making tea takes time. I forget to stop my timer, which is supposed to keep me attached to the keyboard for 30 minutes. In the meantime, while time runs out, I’m setting up the pot, waiting for it to boil, take my tea bag to dip in, fetch milk, make toast. When I come back to my novel, the timer ran out!

Even though my timer counted 30 minutes, I only did 15 minutes of writing. This is not ideal. Tasker aims to solve this problem, or at the very least make our timers more accurate (hence mitigating human errors) by binding our timers to hardware.

This means that while a session is opened in Tasker, it will be detecting hardware interaction. We **DO NOT** record keybaord strokes or sound. We buffer it temporarily and throw it away once we run it througb some logic.
