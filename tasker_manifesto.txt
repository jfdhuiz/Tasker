This is a list of things(technical concerns) we'd like to consider:

*Exceptions:
            -When do we decide to check exceptions?
            -For what classes/objects do we make exceptions?
            -What will be the action(s) that exceptions take?

*OOP:
     -C++ ALLOWS programmers to enforce OOP, but it DOES NOT "force" it like languages
      such as Java/C#
     -How strict should we be with enforcing an OOP-style code design?
     -Should we have ANY functional/non-OOP components?
